freiburg1_xyz works decently
freiburg2_xyz works well
freiburg1_rpy doesn't work at all (slightly better when going higher in framerate, but it just won't work) [sequence with just rotational error]
freiburg3_teddy doesn't finish the tracking
freiburg1_room sort of works (needs a .95 Lowe's threshold, high, and a framerate of 1)
freiburg2_pioneer_360 doesn't finish tracking (to be checked again) [long sequence, differential drive robot]
freiburg1_desk works well
freiburg1_desk2 sort of works (with high Lowe's treshold and framerate and what not, it is okay for most of the trajectory, then weird stuff happens)
freiburg2_desk works decently

Try also seeing if this implementation of bundle adjustment is okay
